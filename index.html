    <section class="intro" id="intro1">
      <p>
        The world is full of beautiful buildings, some of which are so
        exceptional that they have been designated as the new Seven Wonders of
        the World. Here is a list of some of the world’s most impressive
        buildings, including the Taj Mahal in Agra, India, The Great Wall of
        China in Beijing, The Christ the Redeemer Statue in Rio de Janeiro,
        Machu Picchu in Peru, Chichen Itza in Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula, The
        Roman Colosseum in Rome, and Petra (Jordan).
        <br /><br />The campaign to select the new seven wonders of the world
        was started in 2000 by the Swiss foundation 7 Wonders. In 2007, these
        seven were announced as the winners, and the whole list was made public.
        Since Philo of Byzantium categorized the first “Seven Wonders of the
        World” in 250 B.C., simply referring to the “Seven Wonders” is no longer
        explicit enough for an audience to comprehend the framework.
        <br /><br /><br />

        Old 7 Wonders of the World It’s important to note that many of these
        wonders no longer exist due to various reasons such as natural
        disasters, wars, and the passage of time. Additionally, there are also
        lists of modern wonders, such as the New 7 Wonders of the World, which
        were chosen through a global poll conducted in the early 21st century.
        <br /><br />
        Here is a list of the traditional Seven Wonders of the World:
        <br /><br />
        1. Great Pyramid of Giza – Egypt <br />2. Hanging Gardens of Babylon –
        Ancient Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq) <br />3. Statue of Zeus at Olympia
        – Greece <br />4. Temple of Artemis at Ephesus – Turkey <br />5.
        Mausoleum at Halicarnassus – Turkey <br />6. Colossus of Rhodes – Greece
        <br />7. Lighthouse of Alexandria – Egypt.

        The Flavian Amphitheatre usually referred to as the Colosseum or
        Coliseum, is a spectacular amphitheatre that was constructed in Rome and
        inaugurated in AD. 80 by Titus, the son of Vespasian, for a hundred days
        of games that included gladiatorial battles and animal contests. It is
        one of the 7 Wonders of the World. Despite the fact that two-thirds of
        the original structure has been damaged over time, it is one of the most
        well-known tourist locations.

        An Incan site in Peru called Machu Picchu was “found” by Hiram Bingham
        in 1911. It is one of the 7 Wonders of the World. It is close to the
        city of Cuzco. Vilcabamba, a covert Incan bastion used during the
        16th-century revolt against Spanish domination, was what he thought it
        to be. It is one of the few recognized big pre-Columbian ruins that have
        been found almost intact.

        Petra is a remarkable historical and archaeological city in southern
        Jordan. It is also known as Raqmu or Rose City due to its colour. It is
        one of the 7 Wonders of the World. The Nabataean, a Bedouin Arab tribe
        that was native to the area in what is now southwest Jordan, is thought
        to have founded the city of Petra as a trade centre. Petra is situated
        around 150 miles south of Jerusalem and Amman, the capital of Jordan,
        and roughly halfway between Damascus, Syria, and the Red Sea, making it
        a centre of commerce in the region at the time.

        Agra, India’s Taj Mahal is a marble mausoleum complex and one of the
        best examples of Mughal architecture. Shah Jahan (reigned 1628–58) built
        it in memory of his wife Mumtz Maal, known as “Chosen One of the
        Palace,” who passed away in 1631 while giving birth to their 14th child.
        It is one of the New 7 Wonder of the World. It is thought that 20,000
        artisans worked on the Taj Mahal project under the direction of a board
        of architects who were knowledgeable at the time.

        $250,000, the majority of which was obtained through contributions. It
        is 635 tonnes in weight and is situated on the Peak of Corcovado
        Mountain in the Tijuca Forest National Park, which provides views of Rio

        roughly 5,500 miles (8,850 km) long, however, the Chinese claim it is
        actually 13,170 kilometres long (21,200 km). The Great Wall of China was
        built over the course of two millennia, starting in the 7th century BCE.
        The goals of this spectacular organisation at the time included
        management of trade and emigration, border control, imposition of
        tariffs on Silk Road trade, and defence.

        A Mayan metropolis in Mexico is called Chichen Itza. It is located on
        the Yucatán Peninsula, which had great prosperity in the ninth and tenth
        centuries A.D. The mythological great cities, or Tollans, that are
        mentioned in later Mesoamerican literature are also thought to include
        Chichen Itza. The city’s ruins contain religious structures from the
        Maya Civilization, like as the Temple of Kukulkán, which has 365 steps,
        one for each day of the Haab solar calendar.
